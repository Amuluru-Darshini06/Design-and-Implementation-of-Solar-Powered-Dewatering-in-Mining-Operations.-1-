# Solar-Powered Dewatering System (ESP8266/NodeMCU)

An *IoT-enabled solar-powered dewatering system* designed for mining and agricultural applications.
This project uses an ESP8266 (NodeMCU) to monitor *water levels, battery voltage, and pump current* while automatically controlling a water pump. It ensures *safe operation, prevents battery over-discharge, and supports **MQTT telemetry* for remote monitoring.

## âœ¨ Features

* ðŸŒž Powered by *solar energy* with battery backup
* ðŸ’§ *Three float switches* (LOW, MID, HIGH) for water level sensing
* ðŸ”‹ *Battery voltage monitoring* with safety cutoffs
* âš¡ *Pump current sensing* with overcurrent protection
* ðŸ”„ Automatic pump control logic
* ðŸ“¡ *Optional MQTT integration* for IoT dashboards
* ðŸ–¥ Serial debugging output for testing

## ðŸ›  Hardware Requirements

* ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
* Solar panel + charge controller + 12V battery
* Relay module (for pump control)
* Water level float switches (3x)
* ACS712 current sensor
* Voltage divider for battery monitoring

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files

* solar_dewatering_nodeMCU.ino â†’ Main Arduino sketch
* (Optional) README.md â†’ This documentation
## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-dewatering.git
   cd solar-dewatering
   
2. Open solar_dewatering_nodeMCU.ino in Arduino IDE.
3. Install required libraries:

   * *ESP8266WiFi* (built-in)
   * *PubSubClient* (for MQTT, optional)
4. Update WiFi and MQTT credentials in the code.
5. Upload to NodeMCU and open Serial Monitor.
## ðŸ“Š Control Logic

* âœ… Pump *ON* when water level â‰¥ MID and battery voltage is safe.
* â›” Pump *OFF* when water level â‰¤ LOW, tank is FULL (HIGH float), battery too low, or current exceeds limit.

---

## ðŸ“¡ MQTT Topics (optional)

* dewatering/status â†’ Pump ON/OFF status
* dewatering/telemetry â†’ JSON telemetry (levels, voltage, current, pump state)
